# The HTML App of JGiven and JsGiven - Workshop Edition 2024

Please perform the following steps before our Workshop takes place. This way, we can investigate any errors which might occur 
during installation procedure. 

## Prerequisites 

Ensure you have the following tooling:
 * `npm` (https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)
 * Typescript 
 * An IDE supporting Typescript (like IntelliJ ;))
 * Firefox or Chrome (perhaps even both).

## Installation 

Perform the following steps: 
1. Clone the repo `https://github.com/jgiven/jgiven-html-app` and checkout the branch `WR24`.

The repo consists of the existing HTML App (folder `legacy`) and the new HTML App (folder `new`).

2. Navigate to `new` and run `npm install` as well as `npm run build`. 
3. After performing `npm start` you should be able to see the new HTML App in your browser on `localhost:3000`.

## Advice

Have a look at JGiven (http://jgiven.org/, https://github.com/TNG/JGiven) and investigate the
existing HTML-App (https://jgiven.org/jgiven-report/html5/) to get an idea on what we plan to modernize.
